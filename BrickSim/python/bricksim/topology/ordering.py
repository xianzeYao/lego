def bfs_sort_connections(topology: JsonTopology) -> JsonTopology:
    r"""Return a copy of ``topology`` with its connections sorted in a BFS order.

    The intent is to approximate an assembly sequence:

    - We treat the topology as an undirected graph whose vertices are part ids
      and whose edges are individual JsonConnection entries.
    - For each connected component, we pick a root (anchor) and run BFS:
      * If a pose hint exists whose ``part`` lies in the component, we use it
        as the root (if multiple, the smallest id is chosen).
      * Otherwise, we fall back to the smallest part id in the component.
    - While performing BFS we:
      * Emit one "tree" edge the first time we discover a new vertex.
      * Append any remaining edges in the component afterwards, in a
        deterministic order.

    This produces a stable ordering where, within each component, connections
    that introduce new parts appear earlier than connections between already
    visited parts. The ``parts`` and ``pose_hints`` arrays are preserved
    unchanged.

    Args:
        topology: A dict matching the bricksim/lego_topology@2 schema.

    Returns:
        A shallow copy of ``topology`` whose ``\"connections\"`` list has been
        reordered. If there are no connections, the original topology is
        returned unchanged.
