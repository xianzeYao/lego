    """Current physics state for one fixed brick-interface query.

    This object represents the result of querying a single interface pair
    ``query`` against the current physics state of a vectorized environment.
    The state is batched across all environments.

    The query endpoints are scene entities that must resolve to BrickSim brick
    rigid objects, i.e. runtime assets accepted by
    :func:`bricksim.mdp.brick_part.resolve_brick_rigid_object`. Non-physical marker
    bricks and other asset kinds are not supported by this API.

    All tensors are indexed by environment id along dimension 0, so entry
    ``i`` corresponds to environment ``i``. The leading dimension is always
    ``env.num_envs``.

    Attributes:
        query: The fixed stud/hole query that produced this state object.
        connected: Boolean tensor of shape ``(num_envs,)``. ``True`` when the
            queried stud/hole interface pair is currently connected in that
            environment.
        offsets: Integer tensor of shape ``(num_envs, 2)``. When
            ``connected[i]`` is true, ``offsets[i]`` is the BrickSim grid
            offset ``(dx, dy)`` of that connection. When ``connected[i]`` is
            false, the value is unspecified and is currently zero-filled.
        yaws: Integer tensor of shape ``(num_envs,)``. When ``connected[i]``
            is true, ``yaws[i]`` is the BrickSim discrete yaw index for that
            connection. When ``connected[i]`` is false, the value is ``-1``.

    Since this query is for one fixed interface pair, each environment
    contributes at most one connection state to the result.
